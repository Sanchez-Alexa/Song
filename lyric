[Verse 1]
Like a rabbit in headlights
They’re stunned by all your charm
And I feel so damn lucky
To have you on my arm

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can’t help but wonder
How we ended up alright
And I love you like no other
Cause this has never felt so right

[Chorus]
Yeah you can keep me warm on a cold night
Warm on a cold cold night
Yeah you can keep me warm on a cold night
Warm on a cold cold night

[Verse 2]
I want to treat you something special
Give you what you deserve
I want to take you to paradise
In a 1950’s Merc
See upcoming pop shows
Get tickets for your favorite artists

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can’t help but wonder
How we ended up alright
And I love you like no other
Cause this has never felt so right



[Chorus]
You can keep me warm on a cold night
Warm on a cold cold night
Yeah you can keep me warm on a cold night
Warm on a cold cold night

[Interlude]
You can keep me real warm
There’s just one thing

[Bridge]
Girl you could have anyone
So why you choosing me and not leaving me on my own?
Girl you could be with anyone
So thanks for making me your number one

[Chorus]
You can keep me warm on a cold night
Warm on a cold cold night
Yeah you can keep me warm on a cold night
Warm on a cold cold night

[Outro]
Yeah wrap me up and keep warm on a cold night
Warm on a cold cold night
Oh yeah you can keep me warm on a cold night
Warm on a cold cold night
